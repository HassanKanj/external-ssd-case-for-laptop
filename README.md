# External SSD case for the laptop (3D files)

Here’s a custom case I designed so I can easily move my MacBook around with my 2 external storage drives.

This repo contains the designs that I used but I have also included the design file (FreeCAD file) so you can modify the dimensions to suit your needs.

On a side note, I already have a FreeCAD course (in Arabic) on YouTube if you want to learn how to 3D design using the open source program FreeCAD, and here’s the link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH1UzPbO2F4&list=PL-pfG3NLl5jY2lb_iF0CPEH7DVZws4aDY

The design consists of a case and 2 hooks, you can attach the hooks to the case using super glue, and for an extra level of security you can add a duct tape to the opening.

## Disclaimer

Use this 3D model at your own responsibility, and please note the following:

- Based on my own experience, the design seems sturdy, but I still didn't test it extensively, so there are no guarantees regarding that.
- I am not sure if orienting the HDD in this way can have side effects on the hard disk, do your research and decide accordingly (update: it may decrease the lifespan of a normal HDD while it may not have any effects on SSD drives).
- Be careful with the added weight on the screen, since it may cause imbalance and might cause damage to your laptop if the screen tilted too much in a certain direction because of the hard disk weight.
